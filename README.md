## Homework 1
Simple calculator with set of functions:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Factorial
6. Exponentiation

_I created two versions of my project + version with randoms. I tried to implement input from a string. It works well but if I have more than one minus in subtraction it crashes. So I prepared a method with "console selection" as well._
