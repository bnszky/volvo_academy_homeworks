1. How much better it
is to understand it all, to recognise it all, all the impossibilities
and the stone wall; not to be reconciled to one of those
impossibilities and stone walls if it disgusts you to be reconciled to
it; by the way of the most inevitable, logical combinations to reach
the most revolting conclusions on the everlasting theme, that even for
the stone wall you are yourself somehow to blame, though again it is as
clear as day you are not to blame in the least, and therefore grinding
your teeth in silent impotence to sink into luxurious inertia, brooding
on the fact that there is no one even for you to feel vindictive
against, that you have not, and perhaps never will have, an object for
your spite, that it is a sleight of hand, a bit of juggling, a
card-sharper’s trick, that it is simply a mess, no knowing what and no
knowing who, but in spite of all these uncertainties and jugglings,
still there is an ache in you, and the more you do not know, the worse
the ache.
2. The fact is,
gentlemen, it seems there must really exist something that is dearer to
almost every man than his greatest advantages, or (not to be illogical)
there is a most advantageous advantage (the very one omitted of which
we spoke just now) which is more important and more advantageous than
all other advantages, for the sake of which a man if necessary is ready
to act in opposition to all laws; that is, in opposition to reason,
honour, peace, prosperity—in fact, in opposition to all those excellent
and useful things if only he can attain that fundamental, most
advantageous advantage which is dearer to him than all.
3. I
hated the abrupt self-confident tone of his voice, his admiration of
his own witticisms, which were often frightfully stupid, though he was
bold in his language; I hated his handsome, but stupid face (for which
I would, however, have gladly exchanged my intelligent one), and the
free-and-easy military manners in fashion in the “’forties.” I hated
the way in which he used to talk of his future conquests of women (he
did not venture to begin his attack upon women until he had the
epaulettes of an officer, and was looking forward to them with
impatience), and boasted of the duels he would constantly be fighting.
4. I, for instance, would not be in the least surprised if all of a
sudden, _à propos_ of nothing, in the midst of general prosperity a
gentleman with an ignoble, or rather with a reactionary and ironical,
countenance were to arise and, putting his arms akimbo, say to us all:
“I say, gentleman, hadn’t we better kick over the whole show and
scatter rationalism to the winds, simply to send these logarithms to
the devil, and to enable us to live once more at our own sweet foolish
will!” That again would not matter, but what is annoying is that he
would be sure to find followers—such is the nature of man.
5. Oh, tell me, who was it first
announced, who was it first proclaimed, that man only does nasty things
because he does not know his own interests; and that if he were
enlightened, if his eyes were opened to his real normal interests, man
would at once cease to do nasty things, would at once become good and
noble because, being enlightened and understanding his real advantage,
he would see his own advantage in the good and nothing else, and we all
know that not one man can, consciously, act against his own interests,
consequently, so to say, through necessity, he would begin doing good?
6. I will explain; the enjoyment was
just from the too intense consciousness of one’s own degradation; it
was from feeling oneself that one had reached the last barrier, that it
was horrible, but that it could not be otherwise; that there was no
escape for you; that you never could become a different man; that even
if time and faith were still left you to change into something
different you would most likely not wish to change; or if you did wish
to, even then you would do nothing; because perhaps in reality there
was nothing for you to change into.
7. But the reason why he wants sometimes to go off at a tangent may just
be that he is _predestined_ to make the road, and perhaps, too, that
however stupid the “direct” practical man may be, the thought sometimes
will occur to him that the road almost always does lead _somewhere_,
and that the destination it leads to is less important than the process
of making it, and that the chief thing is to save the well-conducted
child from despising engineering, and so giving way to the fatal
idleness, which, as we all know, is the mother of all the vices.
8. They express the consciousness that you have no enemy to
punish, but that you have pain; the consciousness that in spite of all
possible Wagenheims you are in complete slavery to your teeth; that if
someone wishes it, your teeth will leave off aching, and if he does
not, they will go on aching another three months; and that finally if
you are still contumacious and still protest, all that is left you for
your own gratification is to thrash yourself or beat your wall with
your fist as hard as you can, and absolutely nothing more.
9. And of course he knows himself that he is doing himself no
sort of good with his moans; he knows better than anyone that he is
only lacerating and harassing himself and others for nothing; he knows
that even the audience before whom he is making his efforts, and his
whole family, listen to him with loathing, do not put a ha’porth of
faith in him, and inwardly understand that he might moan differently,
more simply, without trills and flourishes, and that he is only amusing
himself like that from ill-humour, from malignancy.
10. I was ashamed (even
now, perhaps, I am ashamed): I got to the point of feeling a sort of
secret abnormal, despicable enjoyment in returning home to my corner on
some disgusting Petersburg night, acutely conscious that that day I had
committed a loathsome action again, that what was done could never be
undone, and secretly, inwardly gnawing, gnawing at myself for it,
tearing and consuming myself till at last the bitterness turned into a
sort of shameful accursed sweetness, and at last—into positive real
enjoyment!
