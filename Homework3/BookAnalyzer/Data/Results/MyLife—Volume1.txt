The Longest Sentence by number of characters: Just at that time I happened to be
in a position to give some correct details regarding this apparent
sacrifice on the part of Mendelssohn, because when I had made a serious
proposal to our general management about increasing the salaries of
several of the poorer members of the orchestra, Lüttichau was requested
to inform me that, according to the King’s latest commands, the
expenditure on the state bands was to be so restricted that for the
present the poorer chamber musicians could not claim any consideration,
for Herr von Falkenstein, the governor of the Leipzig district, who was
a passionate admirer of Mendelssohn’s, had gone so far as to influence
the King to appoint the latter secret conductor, with a secret salary
of six thousand marks.
